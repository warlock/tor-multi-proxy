Dear DeleGate users,

I inform you of the new release of DeleGate available as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DeleGate/9.9.9 (STABLE) -- fixes around SSL

This release includes fixes and extensions especially around SSL.
Users of DeleGate as a HTTP proxy are strongly recommended to
move to this version.

SSL (HTTSP/SSL relay over SSL tunnel)
  It could be almost no use to use DeleGate to relay HTTSP/SSL as
  a HTTP proxy, that is as a SSL-tunnel, where clients are long distant
  from DeleGate, since DeleGate/9.0.3 (July 2005).  This is because
  older DeleGate intentionally dropped SSL connections which seems mal-use
  of SSL-tunnel to relay non-SSL protocols.  For example, Gogole mail was
  almost no use via older DeleGate because of so often drop of connections.

SSL (linking with OpenSSL-1.X)
  - made SSLv2_* optional (for dynamic link with OpenSSL-1.X)
  - added lib*.so.1.0.0 to the library name patterns (for OpenSSL nowadays)
  <URL:http://www.delegate.org/mail-lists/delegate-en/05073>

FTP (relative path toward another directory)
  - make relative path only if under cur. dir (not for RETR ../anotherDir/...)

CFI (handling huge mail header)
   - enlarged acceptable MIME header (128K <- 64K) <include/config.h>
   <URL:http://www.delegate.org/mail-lists/delegate-ja/00597>
   - coped with Output/Content-Type to make header larger
   - fixed duplicated ".CRLF" for pipelined responses

MIME-header-encoding (encoded-word with character code conversion)
   - removed dust (like ^B) generated into MIMEencoded-word
   - enabled catenating e-words of the same charset in base64
   - enabled char. code conv. for multipart head. with CHARCODE=Charset:tosv

Windows (running as a service)
   - distinguished -Pxxx.udp from -Pxxx.tcp as service name on Windows
   - enabled defining the service name with SERVCONF="name:Service Name"
   - enabled -Pxxx/tcp with SERVER=udprelay on Windows service
   - introduced showing version and parameters in the service description
