Dear DeleGate users,

I inform you of the new release of DeleGate available as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DeleGate/9.9.8 (STABLE) -- fixes and extensions especially around FTP

This release includes many fixes and extensions especially around FTP.

New features:

  FTP over HTTP -- tunneling FTP connection over (connectionless) HTTP
    "FTPxHTTP" is a HTTP server which can be used for tunneling the FTP
    protocol over HTTP by a (connectionless) sequence of usual HTTP requests
    (not by CONNECT but by GET and POST). It can be relayed by another
    HTTP proxy for forwarding, filtering or so.
    See <URL:http://www.delegate.org/delegate/Manual.htm#serv_FTPxHTTP>

  FTP Bounce -- rejecting "FTP Bounce" attack by PORT connection
    See <URL:http://www.delegate.org/mail-lists/delegate-en/04896>
        <URL:http://www.delegate.org/delegate/Manual.htm#FTPCONF>

  DYCONF -- Dynamic configuration of DeleGate.
    "DYCONF specifies configuration parameters to be loaded dynamically
    on the beginning of relaying application protocol after the acception
    of a TCP connection from a client before starting a session over it. ..." 
    See <URL:http://www.delegate.org/delegate/Manual.htm#DYCONF>
