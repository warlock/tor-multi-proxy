README_SUBIN:

  This directory "subin" contains executable files to be executed under
the privilege of the super user.  If these optional files are installed,
a DeleGate invoked by normal user can do privileged operations as follows.

  dgpam    -- PAM authentication
  dgbind   -- binding a socket to privileged port
  dgchroot -- changing the root directory

HOW TO INSTALL

  % make           # do make at the root of DeleGate's source
  % cd subin       # come to this directory
  % make install   # su password will be asked on the way

  Those executable files "dgpam" and so on are installed at DGROOT/subin/
  automaticaly by "install.sh" called from Makefile.


Each executable file is given ownership and flags like follows: 

  # chown root dgpam
  # chgrp Group dgpam
  # chmod 6550 dgpam

where Group is the group ID of the user to be permitted to execute
this program, which is specified in a DeleGate parameter as

  OWNER=User/Group 

*** about dgchroot:
 On Linux, shared libraries necessary for chroot are copied automatically
to DGROOT/lib by "install.sh" too.
